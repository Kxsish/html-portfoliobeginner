<h3>Spirited away</h3>

The story line is sweet and very interesting to watch how

strange things.

<h3>Business proposal</h3>
<p>
It was sweet seeing the different realities of a rich boss
and a girl who worked for him and their different lifestyles.
How she would help her family in a chicken shop. 
It was eye opening that even though he, the boss had money
and luxury, he didn't have a family and felt alone. Yet
the girl had family but not a lot of luxury.
